## Functions

## City/Township Data
```{r}
#read in township codes and adjust the shortdesc to make merging easier later on
township_codes <- read_csv("data/data2019/citytownship.csv") %>%
  select(1,2) %>%
  mutate(SHORTDESC = case_when(
    CODE3 == "EMT" ~ "Emigration Canyon",
    CODE3 == "CMT" ~ "Copperton",

## Geographic Data
```{r}
# block level coordinates
blockcity <- read.dbf("data/data2019/blockcentersWBlockGroup.dbf") %>%
  select(GEOID, GEOID10,x,y) %>% st_as_sf(coords = c("x","y"), crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326) %>%   
  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_transform(26912) 
# township shapefile
sf_townships <- st_read("data/data2019/Municipalities_Township/Municipalities_Township.shp") %>%

  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_transform(26912)
#get the city at each block gorups

## Streetlight Data Pre-Processing
```{r}
#mapview(sltaz %>% filter(SL_COTAZID == "1002_0"), col.regions="red") + 
#  mapview(bg)
```

```{r}
sltazbg <- intersect_pct(sltaz,bg)
sltaz_nestbg <- sltazbg %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(SL_COTAZID,GEOID) %>%
  nest(GEOID)
sltaz_nestbgp <- sltazbg %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(SL_COTAZID,coverage) %>%
  nest(coverage)

sltazbgj <- sltazbg %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(-geometry,-intersect_area)
```

```{r}
sl_hbw_1 <- sl_hbw %>%
  left_join(sltaz_nestbg, by = c("origin_zone_name" = "SL_COTAZID")) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  rename("origin_zone_bg" = "GEOID") %>%
  left_join(sltazbgj, by = c("origin_zone_name" = "SL_COTAZID","origin_zone_bg" = "GEOID")) %>%
  rename("origin_zone_cov" = "coverage")
sl_hbw_2 <- sl_hbw_1 %>%
  left_join(sltaz_nestbg, by = c("destination_zone_name" = "SL_COTAZID")) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  rename("destination_zone_bg" = "GEOID") %>%
  left_join(sltazbgj, by = c("destination_zone_name" = "SL_COTAZID","destination_zone_bg" = "GEOID")) %>%
  rename("destination_zone_cov" = "coverage")
```

```{r}
sl_hbw_bg <- sl_hbw_2 %>%
  mutate(hbw_traffic_calibrated_trip_volume = o_d_traffic_calibrated_trip_volume * purpose_hbw_percent) %>%
  mutate(hbw_trip = hbw_traffic_calibrated_trip_volume * origin_zone_cov * destination_zone_cov)

sl_hbw_test <- sl_hbw_bg %>%
  group_by(origin_zone_name,destination_zone_name,hbw_traffic_calibrated_trip_volume) %>%
  summarize(test_hbw_vol = sum(hbw_trip))
```

```{r}
sl_hbw_sum <- sl_hbw_bg %>%
  select(origin_zone_bg,destination_zone_bg,hbw_trip) %>%
  group_by(origin_zone_bg,destination_zone_bg) %>%
  summarize(hbw_trips = sum(hbw_trip))
```


Now that we have a dataset of all the streetlight trips from one block group to another, we can summarize it similarly to how we summarized the LODES data, and determine the number of origins and destinations occurring within each city!

## Streetlight Data Summarized at the Blockgroup/City Level
```{r}
blockgroup_city <- blockpoint_city %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(GEOID,SHORTDESC) %>%
  mutate(GEOID = as.character(GEOID)) %>%
  unique() %>%
  left_join(township_codes, by = c("SHORTDESC" = "SHORTDESC")) %>% 
  mutate(CODE3 = ifelse(CODE3 %in% wfrc_towns, CODE3, "XXX"),
         SHORTDESC = ifelse(CODE3 %in% wfrc_towns, SHORTDESC, "Outside WFRC Area"))
```

```{r}
oside_wfrc <- left_join(sl_hbw_sum,blockgroup_city, by = c("origin_zone_bg" = "GEOID")) %>%
  rename("o_geocode" = "origin_zone_bg", "d_geocode" = "destination_zone_bg")
dside_wfrc <- left_join(sl_hbw_sum,blockgroup_city, by = c("destination_zone_bg" = "GEOID")) %>%
  rename("o_geocode" = "origin_zone_bg", "d_geocode" = "destination_zone_bg")

```

```{r}
oside_wide <- oside_wfrc %>%
  select(-SHORTDESC, -o_geocode) %>%
  group_by(d_geocode, CODE3) %>%
  summarize(SumHBW = sum(hbw_trips)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  rename("GEOID" = "d_geocode")
oside_wide_full <- blockseq %>%
  left_join(oside_wide)%>%
  complete(GEOID,CODE3) %>%
  arrange(CODE3) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = CODE3, values_from = SumHBW, values_fn = sum, names_glue = "{CODE3}_o") %>%
  na_replace(0)
oside_wide_ttl <- oside_wide_full %>% as.tibble() %>%
  mutate(TTL_o = rowSums(.[2:99])) %>%
  select(-XXX_o)
```

```{r}
dside_wide <- dside_wfrc %>%
  select(-SHORTDESC, -d_geocode) %>%
  group_by(o_geocode, CODE3) %>%
  summarize(SumHBW = sum(hbw_trips)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  rename("GEOID" = "o_geocode")
dside_wide_full <- blockseq %>%
  left_join(dside_wide)%>%
  complete(GEOID,CODE3) %>%
  arrange(CODE3) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = CODE3, values_from = SumHBW, values_fn = sum, names_glue = "{CODE3}_d") %>%
  na_replace(0)
dside_wide_ttl <- dside_wide_full %>% as.tibble() %>%
  mutate(TTL_d = rowSums(.[2:99])) %>% 
  select(-XXX_d)
```


```{r}
# merge home and work based data into single dataframe
o_d_ttl <- left_join(oside_wide_ttl, dside_wide_ttl)
```

```{r}
# calculate a fakeid and calculate a column sum
sl_at_blockgroups <- o_d_ttl %>%
  arrange(GEOID) %>%
  mutate(fakeid = row_number() - 1) %>%
  select(198,1:197) %>%
  arrange(fakeid) %>%
bind_rows(summarise(.,
                    across(where(is.numeric), sum),
                    across(where(is.character), ~"colSUM"))) %>%
  slice(n(),1:(n()-1)) %>%
  mutate(fakeid = ifelse(GEOID == "colSUM", 0,fakeid))
```

## Divide by 2
Since we want to compare the SL data with the LODES dataset, we think it is appropriate to divide the trips by two. Logically, there are at least 2 HBW trips that occur for every one job location.

```{r}
sl_at_blockgroups2 <- sl_at_blockgroups %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, funs(. / 2))
```

```{r}
#write output csv to be used in the python script which create the webapp inputs
write_csv(sl_at_blockgroups2, paste0("data/data",year,"/sl_at_blockgroup_level",year,".csv"))
```
