 1.) Download All Nedded Data -- and extract to data/data{year} folder
 
    a.) Download the LODES data from here: https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#j2j
     - LODES section, version LODES8, State Utah, Type OD
     - download ut_od_main_JT00_{year}.csv.gz
     
    b.) Download the Workplace LODES data from here: 
     - LODES section, version LODES8, State Utah, Type WAC
     - download ut_wac_S000_JT00_{year}.csv.gz

     - select year, Block Group layer type, and Utah state
     
    d.) Download Census Blocks from most recent decennial census here: https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-census-blocks-2020/about
    
    e.) Copy over Dist_Small, Dist_Med, and Dist_Lrg from latest model release
    
    f.) Download Counties shapefile from here: https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-county-boundaries/about
    
    g.) Copy over the citytownship.csv (copy from previous year, or consult this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZIX50m9xLAl2E8uDrt8T08phyPgvYgGKjLjlULBxo0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
    
    h.) Download Municipalities Dataset from here: https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-municipal-boundaries/about

    i.) Download Census Tracts from here: https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-census-tracts-2020/about

    j.) Download Census Counties from here: https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-census-counties-2020/explore?showTable=true
     - or copy from previous year's data folder
     
 2.) Update the config.json file with new variable years
 
 3.) Run R Scripts
   
    a.) 0-AddSDtoBG.rmd -- run through each chunk, updating input files
    
    b.) 1-ProcessLEGNforCommutePatterns.rmd
     - the purpose of this script is to run through all the lehd data inputs and
       assign them to geographies
     - be sure to double check the college locations, especially UofU and BYU since
       they have had problems in the past. You man need to do a manual allocation
       (note: this is a manual step that requiresthinking)
     - there is code in there as well to work with "invalid geometries" -- this is
       a manual step where you should replace the invalid geometries with a previous 
       version that has valid geometries
       
 4.) Run Python (2-LEHDCommutePatterns-Web-App-DataPrep.ipynb)
  - some years are hardcoded -- make sure to take note of that and update if needed
  - double check in ArcGISPro that everything is looking ok

 5.) Upload to AGOL
  - sign into agol with username: analytics_wfrc
  - click on content/new item
  - upload zipped .gbd from results folder
  - after uploading, update description of the new feature layer
  - locate Census LEHD Commute Patterns map -- open in map viewer
  - add newly created feature layer, drag and drop all items into layers list
  - add a new label class to each of the new layers
  - save the map once all layers have been entered & label class turned on
  - Make sure that the County and Municipality/Townships layer are transparent 
    with a border and correct labels
  
 6.) Update code
  - update Widgets
     - _site\widgets\LEHDCommutePatternsSidebar  -- Widget.js and Widget.html
     - _site\themes\JewelryBoxTheme\widgets\HeaderController -- Widget.js and Widget.html
     - _site\configs\About\config_widgets_About_Widget_37.json -- info tab
     - _site\config.json -- update date     

 7.) Drag and Drop into Filezilla -- double check values
